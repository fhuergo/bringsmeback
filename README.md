## Brings Me Back

BringsMeBack invites you to create a wishlist of long-lost albums, PDFs, websites that are just no longer online, or that you can't find. If it's something that could be linked to by a URL, you're welcome to include it!

Users on the hunt for treasure can see what other users are requesting, and link the user if they are a crafty finder of long-lost things. Once the nostalgic user confirms that they have received what they're looking for, the finder gets a point!
